          <h1>Needs from previous experiences</h1>
          <p class="lead">I worked for more than 9 years in the mechanical industry, developing softwares and calculation tools used by engineers and technicians for mechanical calculation. Hereafter is an example of a calculation of a tilting pad bearing done with the software Combros. In a previous job, I've been in charge of the pre and post processing of these calculations in order to integrate Combros in the calculation workflow of the engineering department.  </p>
          <figure class="figure">
            <img src="Combros.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Picture of combros calculation from gtw">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Bearing calculation with Combros (source: GTW).</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p class="lead">From my experience, anytime a new tool is provided, there is a need for feedback from the users which is usually done orally or per email and is difficult to track :</p>
          <ul class="lead">
            <li>Has the feedback been properly recorded and stored (more than on a post-it note) ?</li>
            <li>What type of issue is it ? A bug ? An improvement suggestion ? A need for training ?</li>
            <li>Is this an urgent matter or should this wait for a later major release ?</li>
            <li>Has this problem already been solved ? Not yet ?</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="lead">The "go to" solution is usually to set up an Excel file, and the latest collaborating features of MS Office 365 made it easier to work on shared documents, but it doesn't solve
          <h1>Benefits</h1>
          <p class="lead">Such a tool is useful for users, who can report easily anything happening. They are certain that their remarks are saved and that the developpers are notified. They can also go track what solution was decided for their matter. It improves communication and trust with the development team.</p>
          <p class="lead">A ticketing tool is also very useful for the development team who has one entrypoint for user feedback and can more easily organize their work answering user concerns. By using a database, they can easily group similar requests, track the amount of requests over time, know which users are contributing, and so on...</p>
          <h1>Goal</h1>
          <p class="lead">The main goal for such a tool is to be very easily set up and configured. It is easy to use for front-end users to report anything they wish, as well as for the back-end users to analyse and respond to the users feedback.</p>
